Currently empty, will be filled in over time, shouldn't be too much work.

General idea is that we want to be given a directory, and automatically
return all comment in code found in that directory. There should be a tag
to specify whether or not the user would like a recursive search. 

There should probably also be some tags for the exact data structure the
user wants to get back with which mappings, but that can come later.

Should be able to recognize both inline comments, and block comments, 
and be able to deal with multiple types of code within a directory.

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_%28syntax%29#Inline_comments "Comments") has a good reference on comments

More to come, just putting a placemarker in so that I don't forget about it.
